# React Native Smesh Starter

React Native Smesh Starter is a template for React Native projects. It is designed in a simple and convenient way for React Native developers 

## Libraries

We are using [jotai](https://jotai.org/) for state management because it has very simple usage and minimalistic API. Thanks to Daishi

For handling API requests, we are using [React-Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

In our forms, we are using [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

You can see the other libraries in [package.json](https://github.com/smesh-network/react-native-smesh-starter/blob/master/package.json)
